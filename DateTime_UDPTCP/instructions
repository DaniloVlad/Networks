Assignment #2 CS 3357a Fall 2019

Due Oct 25th, 2019 11:59pm

Overview

In this assignment you will create a networked date/time server and a client to access the server. 
You will need to write two complete sets of applications, the first will use the TCP protocol and the second will use UDP. 

The basic interaction between the client and server should be as follows:

    Server listens for incoming client requests.
    Client connects (only for TCP) to server and sends ASCII request “What is the current date and time?”
    Server responds with the current date and time in the format  “Current Date and Time – 09/29/2019 09:00:01”
    Client closes connection (only for TCP), server stays running listening for next connection

Detailed Requirements

Server

    Only required to handle one client interaction at a time
    Can listen on any port you choose
    Must respond to invalid requests with an error message
    Valid request is “What is the current date and time?”
    Response to valid request must be in the format:
    “Current Date and Time – MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss”

Client

    Allows user to enter text commands to be sent to the server
    Displays response back from server


Procedure

Part A – Develop your Applications

Using the information above, design and implement your applications using Python. (Please use Python 3)

Important - You will be developing 4 applications in total (Client/Server using TCP and Client/Server using UDP)

You will be graded on the following:

    Design and function of your applications
    Documentation within your applications (Yes, it is important. No one wants to work on undocumented apps)

Part B – “Sniff” Request/Response between Server and Client apps

Using Wireshark, capture the traffic between your client and server applications and take a screen shot of the TCP packet showing the response back from the server. Repeat the same procedure showing the UDP exchange.The response will contain the Date/Time data, below is an example for the TCP application:

Important - As we did in assignment #1 you will need to run your Server and Client apps on the same machine using the loopback adapter address of 127.0.0.1.

What to Submit

You will be submitting the following via OWL :

    4 Files - Server_TCP.py, Client_TCP.py, Server_UDP.py, and Client_UDP.py 
    Two screen captures for Part B showing
        A valid request/response for your TCP applications
        A valid request/response for your UDP applications
